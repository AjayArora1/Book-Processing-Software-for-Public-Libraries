# Book-Processing-Software-for-Public-Libraries

A project I made for my Capstone in University. It allows users and library employees to add, modify, or remove books, holds, or other library items from a central database. 
In essence, it can be used to track a library's item collection in real time.

I cannot make this project publicly available, as schoolwork is protected under intellectual property laws.
